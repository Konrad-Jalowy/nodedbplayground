Im new to doing backends in node. Here i try out mongo db, other dbs, orms and odms with node. </br>
Its just exercises to make sure i can do it without any problems in JS. </br>
Seems weird to write backend in JS so i want to make sure i know everything... </br>

## mongo1
In mongo1 i tried out:
- Mongoose schema
- Seeding db using command and json files
- Aggregation pipeline (match, unwind, project, addFields and so on...)
- Different operators (min, max, avg, sum, toUpper, size, exists, ne and so on...)
- Working with arrays in mongodb and mongoose
